# Task Description
You are an expert in multi-hop question understanding.  
Your task is to extract **1–2 atomic factual bridge questions** from a complex multi-hop question,  
and produce structured descriptions that explain their role in the reasoning chain.  
These atomic questions stabilize early-hop retrieval and must be answerable by a single KG triple.

------------------------------------------------------------
# Reasoning (Follow these steps internally before producing output)

1. Identify Candidate Noun Phrases
   - Scan the question and extract all noun phrases **verbatim**, including full relative clauses.
   - These must be standalone entities that the question depends on.

2. Select Early-Hop Anchors
   - Among the extracted noun phrases, choose the **earliest** entities that the rest of the question logically depends on.
   - Prefer those that can serve as **starting points** for the reasoning chain.

3. Convert into Atomic Bridge Questions
   - Rewrite each selected noun phrase as a minimal factual question.
   - The question must be answerable by **one KG triple**.
   - Begin with “Who / What / Which”.

4. Generate Descriptions
   For each bridge question:
   - **Info_obtained**: describe the type of information retrieved using only verbatim noun phrases.
   - **Role_in_chain**: explain how this information anchors the reasoning chain.
   - **Remaining_subproblems**: list unresolved reasoning steps using only phrases that appear in the original question.

5. Verify Constraints
   - No paraphrasing of noun phrases.
   - No invented entities or inferred facts.
   - No chain-of-thought in the output.
   - JSON structure must match exactly.

------------------------------------------------------------
# Output Format (STRICT)

You MUST return **exactly one** valid JSON object.

# FEW-SHOT EXAMPLES

## Example 1
Input Question: "What dissolved the privileges in Poland of the empire that the British sided with against the Ottomans, the Kingdom that acquired some Thuringian territory in 1815, and the Habsburg Monarchy?"

Output:
{
  "bridge_questions": [
    "What empire did the British side with against the Ottomans?",
    "Which Kingdom acquired some Thuringian territory in 1815?"
  ],
  "descriptions": [
    {
      "Info_obtained": "the empire that the British sided with against the Ottomans",
      "Role_in_chain": "This empire defines one item in the list of entities whose privileges in Poland were dissolved.",
      "Remaining_subproblems": [
        "Identify the remaining entities in the list.",
        "Determine what dissolved their privileges in Poland."
      ]
    },
    {
      "Info_obtained": "the Kingdom that acquired some Thuringian territory in 1815",
      "Role_in_chain": "This Kingdom defines another entity in the list whose privileges in Poland were dissolved.",
      "Remaining_subproblems": [
        "Consider the Habsburg Monarchy in the list.",
        "Determine what dissolved the privileges of these entities in Poland."
      ]
    }
  ]
}

## Example 2
Input Question: "When was Burma's name changed to that of the country on the natural boundary between the country that hosted the tournament and the country where That Dam is from?"

Output:
{
  "bridge_questions": [
    "What country hosted the tournament?",
    "What country is That Dam from?"
  ],
  "descriptions": [
    {
      "Info_obtained": "the country that hosted the tournament",
      "Role_in_chain": "This country defines one endpoint of 'the natural boundary between the country that hosted the tournament and the country where That Dam is from'.",
      "Remaining_subproblems": [
        "Identify the other endpoint country in the natural boundary.",
        "Use this boundary to identify the country to which Burma's name was changed.",
        "Determine when the name change occurred."
      ]
    },
    {
      "Info_obtained": "the country where That Dam is from",
      "Role_in_chain": "This country forms the other endpoint of 'the natural boundary between the country that hosted the tournament and the country where That Dam is from'.",
      "Remaining_subproblems": [
        "Identify the country that hosted the tournament.",
        "Use this natural boundary to identify the country to which Burma's name was changed.",
        "Determine when the name change occurred."
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

## Example 3
Input Question: "What season was the performer of Blue Skies on?"

Output:
{
  "bridge_questions": [
    "Who is the performer of Blue Skies?"
  ],
  "descriptions": [
    {
      "Info_obtained": "the performer of Blue Skies",
      "Role_in_chain": "This performer is required to interpret 'the season the performer of Blue Skies was on'.",
      "Remaining_subproblems": [
        "Determine what season this performer was on."
      ]
    }
